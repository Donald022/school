                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my role with Jake Keo Real Estate Property Management, I developed and implemented 
                    comprehensive IT infrastructure solutions for multiple Airbnb rental properties. This project 
                    involved setting up secure networks, managing smart devices, and protecting both guests and 
                    property owners from cyber threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project required evaluating security vulnerabilities, implementing network security protocols, 
                    and establishing standardized device installation procedures across numerous properties. I also 
                    created training materials to help property owners understand phishing threats and maintain 
                    secure operations.
                </p>
