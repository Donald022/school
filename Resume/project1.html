                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    As a member of FIRST Robotics Team 801 Horsepower in Merritt Island, FL, I collaborated with 
                    a team of students to design, build, and program competitive robots for FIRST Robotics 
                    competitions during the 2020 season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics challenges teams 
                    to design and build robots that can complete specific game tasks within strict time and 
                    resource constraints. Our team worked together to engineer solutions that balanced mechanical 
                    design, electrical systems, and software programming.
